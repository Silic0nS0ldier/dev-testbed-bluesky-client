# Bluesky Alt Client

An alternate client for Bluesky created to serve as a test bed for web tooling.

Currently;
- End-to-end ES modules support.
  - Caveat: Third party packages are tricky.
    e.g. `@atproto/api` ships as CJS and has a dependency which uses `node:crypto`.
    This complexity is contained within a separately built vendor bundle.
  - Only the TypeScript compiler touches `.ts` sources.
- Bazel-backed devserver using `ibazel`.
- `node_modules` is fully managed by Bazel (generated by `reveal-node-modules.sh`).
  This way types are available to editors for local packages without exposing implementation details.

## Architectural Notes

### Preact

- Prefer `useSignal` over `useState`.

## Plans

### Progressive Web App

Evolve the core web app into a progressive web app. This will act as the core for all native apps
(native apps are more for tighter integrations).

Work on this will begin once the build logic for the current simple web app is finalised.

### iOS App

See [`./build_defs/ios/NOTES.md`](./build_defs/ios/NOTES.md).
  
### Android App

See [`./build_defs/android/NOTES.md`](./build_defs/android/NOTES.md).

### Desktop (Windows, macOS, maybe Linux) App

Plenty of choice, just need to do it.
