# Bluesky Alt Client

An alternate client for Bluesky created to serve as a test bed for web tooling.

Currently;
- End-to-end ES modules support.
  - Caveat: Third party packages are tricky.
    e.g. `@atproto/api` ships as CJS and has a dependency which uses `node:crypto`.
    This complexity is contained within a separately built vendor bundle.
  - Only the TypeScript compiler touches `.ts` sources.
- Bazel-backed devserver using `ibazel`.
- `node_modules` is fully managed by Bazel (generated by `reveal-node-modules.sh`).
  This way types are available to editors for local packages without exposing implementation details.

## Architectural Notes

### Preact

- Prefer `useSignal` over `useState`.
